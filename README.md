# GROUP ASSIGNMENT

We have been working on this group-assignment in an agile project way to create a webpage for sales of christmas trees using typescript, HTML and SCSS. We have been using Jira to implement and structure our work and simplify the teams communication and follow deadlines within 3 weeks. We have also developed our skills to collaborate in Github.
