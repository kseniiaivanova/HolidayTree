# GROUP ASSIGNMENT: WEBSHOP

We have been working on this group assignment in an agile way to create a webpage for sales of Christmas trees. We have been using Jira to implement and structure our work and simplify the teams communication and follow deadlines within 3 weeks. We have also developed our skills to collaborate in Github.
